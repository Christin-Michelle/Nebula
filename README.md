A pet Hexapod based on AI
## Summary 

I have bought myself a hexapod which I intend to turn into a pet and maybe give it some usefull abilities. It should be able to charge itself, reduce energy use so it can always be online (for the charging an according adapter shall be printed in which it can sit while not moving), it shall inspect when the house automation system give a motion detection response and send camera data to a remote server, it should use lidar and optical sensors to move around the house

## Background

The robot at the time is driven by ROS and there are available programs for mapping and remote control and more. but no charging not returning to charging station and no autonomy. I hope to be able to chane this. My personal motivation is just the fun of it and having a robotic pet.

## How it is used

In case I would get this to work actually it could only be used with the same kind of robot bu the basic ideas behind it would probably be easily adapable to other robotic pets
